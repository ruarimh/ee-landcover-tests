# Earth Engine deforestation prediction notebook
A personal project in using Earth Engine to predict Vancutsem et al. deforestation transition maps (see: https://forobs.jrc.ec.europa.eu/TMF/download/) using supervised (Random Forest) and unsupervised (K-means clustering) learning.

Runnable using Google Colab, but requires an Earth Engine account.
